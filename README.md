# TechWave 2025 – College Event Website 🎉

## 📌 Project Description
This is a simple, responsive website created for the **UPES CSI Technical Committee assignment**. It contains essential information about the TechWave 2025 college event — including event schedule, registration form, and contact info.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (basic form validation)
- Netlify (for live demo deployment)

## 🚀 How to Run / Install
1. Clone or download this repository as ZIP
2. Open the folder and double-click `index.html`
3. All pages are connected via links (Home → Events → Register → Contact)

## 🌐 Live Demo
👉 [Click Here to View](https://your-netlify-link.netlify.app)  
_*(replace this with your real link once hosted)*

## 🧠 Challenges Faced
- **OneDrive storage errors** caused sync problems and red icons on folders
- **VS Code color picker bug** was adding color boxes in CSS (solved by retyping manually)
- Difficulty linking pages properly in the beginning (fixed by using correct file names and paths)

## ✅ Final Note
This website was built from scratch as part of the technical committee task. It is clean, beginner-friendly, and meets all submission requirements (GitHub + Live Demo).
